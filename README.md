    I am a student at Brown University with a passion for learning and building. Much of my work is private due to projects falling under NDAs, or coursework that I cannot reproduce publicly. I am particularly interested in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, and the ways we can use data in a functional way (and automate such use!). I am also interested in security, and I'm a privacy enthusiast.

   My coursework includes Data Structures & Algorithms, Functional Programming (achieved in Racket and ReasonML), Computer Systems, Machine Learning, Probability & Statistics, and lots of pure & applied mathematics!
